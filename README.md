# MRBLANK_RA-Research-Assistant

> **Multi-AI Research Assistant** — Universal file ingestion, 12-point paper extraction, knowledge graph, and academic writing engine.

---

##  Overview

MRBLANK_RA is a self-hosted research assistant that connects to multiple AI backends (Ollama, Gemini, Claude, OpenRouter, etc.) and provides a complete workflow for academic research:

- **Ingest** any file (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, HTML, TXT, MD) — auto-converts to Markdown
- **Extract** papers using the 12-point Elite Extraction Protocol via AI
- **Search** across 5 academic databases (OpenAlex, Crossref, Semantic Scholar, ArXiv, PubMed)
- **Visualize** research with a multi-dimension knowledge graph
- **Chat** with AI using your research library as RAG context
- **Track** keywords, predatory journals, and version changelog

---

##  Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
# Clone or download
cd MRBLANK_RA-Research-Assistant/web-app

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure AI

Copy and edit the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set at least one AI key (or use local Ollama):

| Engine | How to Get |
|--------|-----------|
| **Ollama** (free, local) | Install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com), pull a model like `llama3` |
| **Gemini** (free tier) | Get key at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) |
| **Claude** | API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |
| **OpenRouter** (free models) | Key from [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) |

### 3. Run

```bash
python main.py
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8000** in your browser.

>  **Windows users:** Double-click `START-SERVER.bat`

##  Features

###  Universal File Ingestion
| Format | Auto-converts to .md |
|--------|:---:|
| PDF |  (via PyMuPDF or Docling) |
| DOCX / DOC |  |
| PPTX / PPT |  |
| HTML / HTM |  |
| TXT / CSV / JSON |  |

###  Multi-AI Engine Router
Tries enabled engines in priority order. First one that responds wins — **your AI never stops**.

Supported: `Ollama` · `LM Studio` · `Gemini` · `Claude (API)` · `Claude (CLI)` · `OpenRouter` · `Custom OpenAI-compatible`

###  Academic Web Search
Search across 5 sources simultaneously:

- **OpenAlex** — 250M+ works
- **Crossref** — scholarly publishing metadata
- **Semantic Scholar** — AI-powered paper discovery
- **ArXiv** — pre-prints
- **PubMed** — biomedical literature

With automatic predatory journal filtering, PDF download, and 12-point AI analysis.

###  Knowledge Graph
Visualize your research across 7 dimensions:

`Author` · `Year` · `Journal` · `Quartile` · `Method` · `Framework` · `Keyword`

Multi-layer filtering with AND/OR logic. Built-in Obsidian vault integration.

###  12-Point Extraction Protocol
Every paper is analyzed through:

1. The Problem
2. The Gap
3. Research Question(s)
4. Purpose / Objective
5. Theory / Framework
6. Methodology
7. Key Findings
8. Contribution
9. Limitations
10. Implications
11. Key Citations
12. Critical Position

###  Chat with RAG
Chat with any enabled AI engine. Automatically injects relevant context from your research library — no manual file selection needed.
